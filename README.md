## What is JavaScript?
### Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming lanuage for the web and is the the final piece needed to make your websites come to life. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 to make it easier to add interactive and dynamic elements to websites. Today, the language is used for all sorts of applications, from programming a robot with an Arduino to writing a game script in Unity or even building a code editor. The opportunities with JavaScript truly are endless.

### History of JavaScript
JavaScript was created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich back in 1995, while Eich was working on Netscape Navigator. Netscape Navigator was one of the Internet’s first web browsers. Nowadays, you use browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge to surf the web. Prior to Eich’s creation of JavaScript, websites just existed as pages of HTML and CSS with the occasional plug-in or Java applet (Java is not related to JavaScript in any way). JavaScript was originally called LiveScript, but it was changed to JavaScript as a marketing decision in order to cash in on the popularity of Java at the time. As the language evolved, competing versions of the language emerged, so JavaScript was eventually taken to Ecma International so that an official standard could be formed. Today, the language itself is still referred to as JavaScript, however, recent versions are referenced by their ECMAScript version number, such as, ES5 or ES6. Even more recently, the standards body has transitioned to a year-based number to promote a more consistent release cycle. So we now have ES2016, ES2017, etc. All things considered, JavaScript has grown to be one of the most popular languages in the world and is considered one of the three foundational pillars of front end web development.

**Note:**
- HTML and CSS are markup languages. Markup languages are used to describe and define elements within a document. 
- JavaScript is a programming language. Programming languages can be used to control the behavior of a machine and to express algorithms.

### The JavaScript Console
> The first thing you’ll need to do is open up the developer tools. You can do this by right clicking on the page, and selecting Inspect. Once you have the developer tools open, you can find the JavaScript Console by clicking on the Console tab. If you like keyboard shortcuts, you can also use Cmd+Option+J on a Mac to open the console, or you can use Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows. There’s a really useful reference of keyboard shortcuts for developer tools linked below. To write your first line of JavaScript code, let’s start by writing your name. As you will see, just writing your name will actually result in an error. To be able to actually write your name in JavaScript without any error you need to format your name as a data type called a string put inside quotes. Why don’t we try something else? Here’s some code that creates an alert that says, Hello, Julia, how are you? And it pushes it to the browser. Now writing code directly in your browser is something you can do to test out new code snippets where you’re not really sure what they do. But it could actually get pretty annoying once you start writing larger and larger programs. For example, if you wanted to create two alerts instead of just one, it may seem simple at first, but each time you need to go to the next line, you would have to type Shift+Return instead of just the Return key. This is going to get pretty annoying pretty fast. Eventually, you’ll learn about other ways to run JavaScript files. But for now we recommend using a text editor like Atom or Sublime Text and then pasting your code in the console once you’re ready to test it. - Udacity
