### Intro to JavaScript
> JavaScript is a programming language created for the web. If you’re familiar with using HTML and CSS to create webpages, JavaScript is the final piece that you’ll need to really make your websites come to life. Back in 1995, when Brandan Eich created JavaScript, it was created to make it easier to add interactive and dynamic elements to websites. But today, JavaScript is used for all sorts of applications. From programming a robot with an Arduino to writing a game script in Unity. In fact, even some code editors were built with JavaScript. The point is, the opportunities with JavaScript are endless.
