## What is JavaScript? <a id="what-is-javascript"></a>
### Introduction to JavaScript <a id="introduction-to-javascript"></a>
> JavaScript is a programming language created for the web. If you’re familiar with using HTML and CSS to create webpages, JavaScript is the final piece that you’ll need to really make your websites come to life. Back in 1995, when Brandan Eich created JavaScript, it was created to make it easier to add interactive and dynamic elements to websites. But today, JavaScript is used for all sorts of applications. From programming a robot with an Arduino to writing a game script in Unity. In fact, even some code editors were built with JavaScript. The point is, the opportunities with JavaScript are endless. - Julia Van Cleve & James Parkes

### History of JavaScript <a id="history-of-javascript"></a>
> JavaScript was created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich back in 1995, while Eich was working on Netscape Navigator. For those of you who don’t know, Netscape Navigator was one of the Internet’s first web browsers. Today, you use browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge to surf the web. Prior to Eich’s creation of JavaScript, websites just existed as pages of HTML and CSS with the occasional plug-in or Java applet. Java is not related to JavaScript in any way. The fact is, JavaScript has had sort of a weird past when it comes to names. JavaScript was originally called LiveScript but it was changed to JavaScript as a marketing decision in order to piggyback off the popularity of Java at the time. As the language evolved, competing versions of the language emerged. So JavaScript was eventually taken to Ecma International so that an official standard could be formed. Today, the language itself is still referred to as JavaScript. But recent versions are referenced by their ECMAScript version number, like ES5 or ES6. Even more recently, the standards body has transitioned to a year-based number to promote a more consistent release cycle. So we now have ES2016, ES2017, and so on. All things considered, JavaScript has grown to be one of the most popular languages in the world and is considered one of the three foundational pillars of front end web development. - Julia Van Cleve & James Parkes

> **TIP:** HTML and CSS are markup languages. Markup languages are used to describe and define elements within a document. JavaScript is a programming language. Programming languages can be used to control the behavior of a machine and to express algorithms. - Julia Van Cleve & James Parkes
