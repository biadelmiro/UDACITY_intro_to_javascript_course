## Data Types and Variables
### Introduction to Data Types
- Data is everywhere. 
- It’s the grade you made on your first math test. 
- It’s the conversation you have with a loved one. 
- It’s the decision you made to sit down and watch this video. 
- All of these things can be represented as data.
- Data’s important because it helps us understand the world, recognize trends, make educated guesses and inform our future decisions.
- This is no different in programming. 
- Data and data types are the building blocks of any programming language because they help us organize information and determine how our programs will run. 
- When you look on your Facebook profile, what do you see? Your name, the number of friends you have, the date of your last post, a list of status updates and whether you liked the comment your friend just made. 
- All this information is being gathered, calculated and presented to your friends and family visiting your profile. 
- And when you look at your bank account, what do you see? An account number, an account balance, dates of each transaction and the name of the company that you made a purchase from. It’s important to be aware of what types of data you’re using and when it’s appropriate to use each type. In this lesson, we’ll start by learning how to define and manipulate the primitive data types of JavaScript. Numbers, strings, Booleans, undefined and null. Once you’re familiar with these data types, you’ll see how you can store data into variables so you can reuse and manipulate data throughout your code.
