## Introduction to JavaScript
- JavaScript is a programming language for the web
- It is the the final piece needed to make your websites come to life
- It was created to make it easier to add interactive and dynamic elements to websites
- It can also be used to program a robot, write a game script or build a code editor
- It has grown to be one of the most popular languages in the world

## History of JavaScript
- JavaScript was created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich back in 1995
- Prior to JavaScript, websites just existed as pages of HTML and CSS with the occasional plug-in or Java applet
- It was originally called LiveScript, but was changed to JavaScript due to Java's popularity at the time
- Due to competing versions emerging, JavaScript was taken to Ecma International to be standardized
- Recent versions can also be referenced by their ECMAScript version number, such as, ES5 or ES6
- More recently, it uses a year-based number to promote a more consistent release cycle with ES2016, ES2017, etc.
